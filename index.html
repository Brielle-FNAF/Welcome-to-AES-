        <p>Ardmore elementary school

           Ardmore Elementary school is where K-5 grade is being teached. Ardmore was found by a Principal called "Principal Herring".

            Mrs. Herring is the first one to find this school. <br><br>Mrs. Melreta Herring was appointed Principal of Ardmore Elementary School July 1, 2019 serving approximately 407 students in grades Pre-K through fifth grade. Prior to her appointment, she served nineteen years as a classroom teacher and two years as an Assistant Principal at Ardmore Elementary School. Mrs. Herring is a graduate of Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, D.C and Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. She also has a Masters degree in Education Administration from Grand Canyon University. 


            In addition, Mrs. Herring has over thirty years of educational experience. Her love for children and their well-being has motivated her to this level. Her motto is, “If a child cannot learn the way we teach, we should teach the way they learn.” by Ignacio Estrada.  She is a member of Naomi Grand Chapter Order of Eastern Star and serves her community as a Sunday School Teacher at United Baptist Church.  She is married and a mother of two sons and a daughter. 

            As educators, we believe all students have the right to a quality educational program that will develop them into becoming productive citizens in our community. We believe that students should have a well-organized and well-structured academic program that will build strong academic preparation, social and interpersonal skills, and esthetic appreciation for the performing arts. We believe the education of all students is not confined to the school alone.
The home, the community, and other institutions must play important roles to ensure all students are academically and socially prepared to become lifelong learners. To provide the best education possible for every student, there must be full participation and collaboration between the school, community, parents, teachers, students and administrators.</p>
